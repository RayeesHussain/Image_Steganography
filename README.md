- Steganography-Hiding text in a message project aims to design and implement a robust system for concealing information within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. 
- The project scope involves the development of an algorithm that embeds data into the least significant bits of pixel values, ensuring minimal visual impact. 
- The guidelines for the project include addressing security concerns to withstand steganalysis techniques, optimizing data capacity, and providing a user-friendly interface for embedding and extracting hidden information. 
- Objectives encompass exploring practical applications of image steganography, testing the system's performance, and considering future advancements in steganographic techniques. 
- The project strives to strike a balance between data hiding capacity and visual quality while offering a secure and efficient solution for various applications, such as secure communication and data protection.
